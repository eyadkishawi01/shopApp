  "The new Galaxy A53 5G is now here for review. Since the 5X series has arguably been one of the better-geared devices in the series, it is also the toughest one to upgrade. In comparison, this year's Galaxy A33 5G is a much lower hanging fruit seeing how its predecessor came with an LCD.",
  "Last year’s iPhone X was a massive leap forward in design for Apple after years of resting on its laurels. This year the iPhone XS Max is essentially that winning design stuck in a photocopier on 112%, which doesn’t sound a lot but makes quite a difference.",
  "The back is now made of ceramics, a material that's substantially harder than glass, so scratching this one won't be easy. The unfortunate consequence of using ceramics is that the phone is only available in White or Black. No funky colors this time around - but that's a trade-off we'd happily make.",
  "If you’re happy to live with Huawei’s version of Android, the P30 Pro is a fantastic flagship that packs in enough to make it just about worth its high £899 asking price. The camera here is incredible, the battery life superb and the design slick enough to help it stand out.",
  "The Redmi Note 10 Pro is a solid offering for the money, but the competition is fierce. The mid-tier processor could perform better and Redmi's software is an uneven affair. However, the combined value of a fast display, well-rounded design, and long-lasting battery life makes for a compelling upper-budget-tier smartphone.",
  "Lenovo has posted a few real-life images of its upcoming Legion Y700 gaming tablet, with the device looking striking in each picture. Speculation over the specs and price for the Lenovo Legion Y700 has already started and there is even suggestion there may be a higher-specced Y900 variant."
